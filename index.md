# muhammad shahab hameed * senior software engineer

Hi! If you've stumbled onto this page, you're probably lost, or something piqued your interest on one of my social media presences. Provided most of my social media posts are tech related or random ramblings, I'm guessing it's the former. In any case, if you feel like reading forward, I'll do my best to give you a quick CliffsNotes version of an "about me" section, as you most certainly have more important things to do.

## about me
* People call me Muhammad
* A wandering aspirant with a knack for ones and zeros.
* I'm a Backend Developer, currently exploring Cloud Native Space
* Learning K8s, Golang, AWS
* In my free time, I love to attend Meetups for learning & read tech articles
* It may look like I’m doing nothing, but in my head, I’m very busy.
* Interests: Software Development, Distributed Computing, Artificial Intelligence, Computer Vision
* I'm very happy you made it this far

## more about me
If any of the above sounds interesting, and you'd like to learn more, please [contact](/contact) me! If you're not quite there yet, and need some more convincing, I invite you over to [my long-form intro](/shahabhameed), which is much more rambly, but also more informative!
