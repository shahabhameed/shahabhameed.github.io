# muhammad shahab hameed * senior software engineer

Hi! If you've stumbled onto this page, you're probably lost, or something piqued your interest on one of my social media presences. Provided most of my social media posts are about movies or eating lunch, I'm guessing it's the former. In any case, if you feel like reading forward, I'll do my best to give you a quick CliffsNotes version of an "about me" section, as you most certainly have more important things to do.

## about me
* People call me Muhammad
* I'm very happy you made it this far

## more about me
If any of the above sounds interesting and you'd like to learn more, please [contact](/contact) me! If you're not quite there yet, and need some more convincing, I invite you over to [my long-form intro](/shahabhameed), which is much more rambly, but also more informative!
